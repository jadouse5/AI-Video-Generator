#Introduction
'''Hi, I’m Jad Tounsi El Azzoiani, and this project explores AI video generation with the open-source Wan2.1 model by Wan-AI. Wan2.1 is a cutting-edge video generative model that creates high-quality videos from text prompts. I’m using the T2V-1.3B model (~8.19GB VRAM) to generate a 480p video of "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fighting intensely on a spotlighted stage" in Google Colab’s free tier, tackling resource challenges along the way.

This notebook highlights Wan2.1’s power as an open-source tool for Text-to-Video and beyond, featuring innovations like visual text generation and a robust Video VAE. Join me as I set up, debug, and showcase AI video creation!'''
